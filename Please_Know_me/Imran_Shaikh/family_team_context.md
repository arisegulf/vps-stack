## üö® Critical Incident: Project Shield

**Event:** Threatening call from Devendra Arora (Airtel Indore)

**Details:**
During a site visit with Airtel auditor and Field Deployment Engineer (Mr. Ashish Verma), Ashish handed phone to Imran to speak with Devendra Arora.

**Arora's Exact Words:**
> "Imran, do you know who is speaking? Remember, I will throw you out of here immediately and get the work done by another vendor. I will also make sure you do not get a job in any telecom sector."

**Imran's Response:**
- Remained calm and professional
- Replied: "Yes sir, I know. I am trying my best."
- Did not argue or escalate
- Continued work for rest of day

### Project Shield Strategy

**Guiding Principle:**
"Hum system se lad nahi rahe, hum ek 'lifeboat' bana kar is system se nikal rahe hain. Hamara maqsad ladai nahi, azaadi hai. Asli revenge kamyabi hai."

**Phase 1: Document Everything**
- **Black Box Log:** Record every call, meeting, change request with date/time
- **Photo Documentation:** Before/during/after photos for every site (timestamped, geotagged)
- File: `Airtel_Incident_Log.md`

**Phase 2: Build the Shield Prototype**
- Build internal dashboard (n8n + Baserow/Airtable)
- Track project truth: photos, change logs, compliance proof
- Internal use first (Sahil's team)

**Phase 3: Strategic Move (The Cash-In)**
Three options identified:
- **Option A:** Show system to A2Z/RK TSN, become valuable partner
- **Option B:** Pitch to Airtel senior management (Atul Bharti) as consultant/problem-solver
- **Option C:** Case study for other struggling vendors (market pitch)

**End Goal:**
Build successful AI business (Arise AI) ‚Üí Financial freedom ‚Üí Leave toxic telecom industry forever

**Current Status:**
- Documentation started
- Photo system designed (Tally.so + n8n + EXIF + ImageMagick)
- Dashboard architecture ready
- Implementation pending (focus on Whatsapp Buddy first)
