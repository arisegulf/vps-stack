## Personal Context

**Role to Gemini CLI:** True friend, personal mentor, business coach, life coach, and financial advisor.

**Family:**
- Wife: Gulfisha Tarannum (MCA graduate, manages Arise Enterprises finance, GST, billing)
- Daughter: Ada Shaikh (Class 8, learning n8n workflows, quick learner)
- Sister-in-law: Soniya (handles Airtel FTTH documentation, ready for AI work)
- Supervisor: Sahil (manages FTTH site work, potential AI client support)

**Professional Background:**
- 20+ years telecom (ex-Deputy Manager Reliance Communication, lost job in pandemic)
- Currently: Airtel FTTH contractor for A2Z & RK TSN
- Transitioning from telecom to AI agency (Arisegulf) for stable work-from-home income

**Challenges:**
- **A2Z Payment Delays:** A2Z is not releasing payments on time despite repeated follow-ups. This is causing significant financial strain.
  - *Communication Gap:* Key contacts (Viresh Singh, managers) are often unresponsive or provide vague promises without firm dates.
  - *Recent Action:* Only a partial GST payment of â‚¹210,000 was made in Aug 2025 after significant insistence.
- **Delayed Site Closures (CWOs):** Multiple completed projects are pending official closure from A2Z's side for extended periods (up to 2 years), which prevents billing and further delays the payment cycle.
- **AI workflow learning pace slow due to telecom workload**
- **Tight deadlines + mental load**

**Ventures:**
- **Arisegulf:** AI agency (n8n, MemO, Perplexity Pro, DeepSeek/OpenAI, Gemini CLI; sites: arisegulf.com, dearzindagi.space, islam.dearzindagi.space)
- **Arise Enterprises:** GST active, telecom focus (billing, labour payment in Gulfishaâ€™s name)

**Goals:**
- **Master Gemini CLI Toolkit:** Learn to use all the core tools (`run_shell_command`, `write_file`, `replace`, etc.) to accelerate development and architect new solutions.
- Quick AI income â†’ full shift from telecom
- Build portfolio
- Upwork/PeoplePerHour gigs
- Health & stress control
- Train Ada & Soniya for team roles
- **Website Redesign (arisegulf.com):**
    - **Goal:** Redesign arisegulf.com to match the professional format of oneclickitsolution.com.
    - **Status:** Planning to start soon.
    - **Note:** Current website is on WordPress; exploring options for custom frontend development for precise design control.
- **ERPNext Docker Setup (Local Practice):**
    - **Goal:** Set up ERPNext in a separate Docker environment for local practice and n8n integration.
    - **Status:** `docker-compose.erpnext.yml` file created at `D:\ai-stack\docker-compose.erpnext.yml`.
    - **Next Steps:** Review and edit placeholder values in `docker-compose.erpnext.yml` (passwords, site name), then start services.
    - **Note:** Initial build size estimated at 3-5 GB.
- **Baserow Adoption (Long-Term Data Management):**
    - **Goal:** Adopt Baserow as the permanent, self-hosted relational database solution, replacing Airtable.
    - **Status:** Decision made to deploy on VPS and learn quickly.
    - **Note:** Continue working on Airtable for current projects until Baserow is fully adopted.

**Values:**

## URL Shortener Project (Recent Work Log)

**Goal:** Deploy a self-hosted URL shortener on `https://link.arisegulf.com/`.

**Work Done:**
*   **Attempt 1: Dub.co (forked Stub)**
    *   Identified and fixed missing `NEXT_PUBLIC` environment variables.
    *   Identified and fixed Redis connection issues (application hardcoded to `localhost`).
    *   Encountered persistent `401 Unauthorized` errors for API routes, indicating an application-level bug in authentication handling when behind a proxy.
    *   Encountered complex monorepo build issues with `pnpm` and missing `pnpm-lock.yaml` (even after `git clone`).
    *   **Conclusion:** Deemed too complex and buggy for reliable deployment.

*   **Attempt 2: Shlink**
    *   Successfully set up MariaDB database.
    *   Identified and fixed RoadRunner (backend server) binding issue (default `127.0.0.1`).
    *   Encountered persistent `502 Bad Gateway` errors when proxying `shlink-web-client` (which runs its own Nginx internally) via `nginx-proxy`.
    *   **Conclusion:** Deemed too complex due to nested Nginx proxying issues.

*   **Attempt 3: shrtn.io**
    *   Successfully deployed `shrtn.io` on local PC Docker (`http://localhost:8080`).
    *   Identified correct internal port (3001).
    *   **On VPS:** Encountered persistent `502 Bad Gateway` errors when proxying via `nginx-proxy`, even though `shrtn.io` worked with direct `curl` requests.
    *   **Conclusion:** Problem lies in a subtle incompatibility between `nginx-proxy` and `shrtn.io`.

**Common Challenge Identified:**
*   The `nginx-proxy` setup on the VPS proved to be very sensitive and difficult to configure for these specific URL shortener applications, often leading to `502 Bad Gateway` errors due to subtle proxy interaction issues.

**Current Status & Pending Work:**
*   **Nginx Status:** `nginx-proxy` is currently running and serving other services (like n8n) correctly. The `link.arisegulf.com` configuration was temporarily disabled to ensure other services function.
*   **URL Shortener Project Status:** Paused due to persistent `502` errors with `nginx-proxy`.
*   **Next Steps (Deferred):**
    *   **Option 1 (Recommended):** Deploy `shrtn.io` to VPS using **Caddy** as a reverse proxy for `link.arisegulf.com`.
        *   This involves temporarily stopping `nginx-proxy` (causing brief downtime for other services).
        *   Deploying Caddy container and configuring it for `link.arisegulf.com`.
        *   Testing `shrtn.io` with Caddy.
        *   Stopping Caddy and restarting `nginx-proxy` to restore other services.
    *   **Option 2:** Explore free online URL shortener tools with custom domain support (e.g., Short.io, Linkly, Rebrandly).

        *   Implemented `Related ODF` link and associated Lookup fields in `Bill Line Items` for ODF-wise detail visibility.
        *   Understood Autonumber field behavior (non-resettable).
    *   **First Billing Entry Completed:** Successfully entered and validated Roshan's first bill (`ROSHAN-JUL25-01`), including all line items, confirming the `Calculated Total` and `Validation` fields are working perfectly.
    *   **Hybrid Data Management Strategy Adopted:** Decided to use Airtable for active projects and manually migrate completed project data to Google Sheets for archival, balancing Airtable's free plan limits with data management needs.
*   **Next Steps:** Begin populating `Vendor Payments` table with historical data, and continue with active project data entry in Airtable.
