## üö® Critical Decisions & Constraints

**Decisions Made:**
1. **Focus:** One product (Whatsapp Buddy) for next 30 days - NO EXCEPTIONS
2. **No new infrastructure:** Use what's already built
3. **No website redesign:** Postponed (WordPress decommissioned, React rebuild later)
4. **Client approach:** Local shops, personal demos first
5. **Ada's role:** Learning only, NOT production-critical systems
6. **A2Z strategy:** Aggressive follow-up + legal notice preparation + reduce dependency
7. **Baserow adoption:** Long-term database solution (replacing Airtable eventually)

**Known Constraints:**
1. **Cash flow crisis:** A2Z payments severely delayed
2. **Resource overload:** Imran juggling multiple roles
3. **Team limitations:** Ada is 13 (student), Sahil inconsistent
4. **Tool expertise gap:** Functional but not deep knowledge
5. **Infrastructure > Implementation:** Built too much, delivered too little
6. **Spread too thin:** 5+ projects simultaneously (needs focus)

**Hard Rules:**
- Master Context File gets updated weekly
- No new projects until Whatsapp Buddy has 1 paying customer
- Infrastructure changes only if critical/blocking
- Every tool must justify its server cost with revenue potential
