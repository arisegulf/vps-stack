### Client: RK Technosmart (via Shristi Enterprise)

**Workflow:**
- **End Client:** RK Technosmart NETWORK COMPANY (Website: http://rktsn.com/)
- **Primary Contractor:** Shristi Enterprise (owned by Imran's friend, Ranjeet)
- **Our Role:** Arise Enterprises works as a sub-contractor for Ranjeet.
- **Billing Process:** We provide a manual, non-GST bill to Ranjeet (Shristi Enterprise). Ranjeet's firm then invoices RK Technosmart directly. Payments are made from Ranjeet to Arise Enterprises.

**Business Context:**
- This work was started around March 2025, primarily due to increasing payment delays from A2Z Infra.
- **Trade-off:** While payments from Ranjeet are faster and more reliable, the projects have to be executed at a lower cost, resulting in smaller profit margins compared to A2Z projects.

*This section tracks all projects executed for RK Technosmart via Ranjeet.*

| Project Area | Status | Bill Amount (to Ranjeet) | Payment Received | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Operations & Team Management

This section outlines the project execution workflow, detailing how manpower and teams are managed for both A2Z and RK Technosmart projects.

### Execution Strategy
We use a hybrid model for project execution to balance cost, speed, and direct control:
- **Outsourcing:** For larger project scopes, work is handed over to trusted, small, non-GST sub-contractor teams.
- **In-house Execution:** To reduce costs on certain project segments, we use our own internal team supervised by Sahil. While this reduces costs, it increases management involvement.

### Teams & Sub-Contractors
This table tracks all internal and external teams responsible for fieldwork.

| Team Lead / Supervisor | Team Type | Billing & Payment Process |
|---|---|---|
| **Sahil** | **Internal (Self Team)** | Sahil is a salaried supervisor. He manages laborers who are paid on a daily basis for their work. |
| **Shiwanshu Singh** | External Sub-Contractor | Provides a bill for completed work. Payment is made against the bill. |
| **Roshan** | External Sub-Contractor | Provides a bill for completed work. Payment is made against the bill. |
| **Sunil** | External Sub-Contractor | Provides a bill for completed work. Payment is made against the bill. |
